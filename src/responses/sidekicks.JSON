    "<@[userOne]>, <@[userTwo]> :tada: Why don't you two have a coffee or tea break Thursday at 10 AM? I would if I were free.",
    "<@[userOne]>, <@[userTwo]> You two got matched to meet up and get to know each other better. Are you both free Friday at lunch?",
    "Hey <@[userOne]> and <@[userTwo]>. You were chosen to meet up with each other this week. Let's all meet up at a cafe on Tuesday (I can't make it)."
